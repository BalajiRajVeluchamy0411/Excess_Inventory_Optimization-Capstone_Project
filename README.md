# Teradyne Excess Inventory Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize excess inventory management at Teradyne using data analytics and machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical demand, supply chain data, and lead times, we seek to streamline inventory operations, reduce holding costs, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Utilize pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization.
- **Machine Learning:** Apply regression and clustering algorithms to forecast demand, identify excess inventory, and optimize stocking levels.
- **Lead Time Analysis:** Calculate lead times and assess their impact on inventory management decisions.
- **Cost Reduction Strategies:** Implement strategies to minimize excess inventory costs while ensuring adequate supply to meet demand.

## Project Structure
- **Data:** Raw and processed data files stored in the `/data` directory.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization in the `/notebooks` directory.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation in the `/scripts` directory.
- **Results:** Presentation slides, reports, and summaries in the `/results` directory.
